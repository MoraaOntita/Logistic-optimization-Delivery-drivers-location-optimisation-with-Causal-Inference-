# Gokada Last Mile Delivery Optimization Project

## Overview
The Gokada Last Mile Delivery Optimization Project aims to enhance delivery fulfillment rates by analyzing historical data and leveraging advanced analytics techniques. This project is conducted as part of [your organization or training program].

### Business Need
Gokada is the largest last mile delivery service in Nigeria, facing challenges with sub-optimal pilot (driver) placement leading to high rates of unfulfilled delivery requests. This project seeks to identify root causes of unfulfilled orders and propose data-driven solutions to improve operational efficiency.

### Key Objectives
- Analyze historical data to understand factors influencing delivery success rates.
- Implement machine learning models and causal inference techniques to predict and optimize pilot placements.
- Create visualizations to communicate insights and recommendations effectively.

## Project Structure

### Tasks
1. **Data Exploration and Feature Engineering**:
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends in delivery requests.
   - Engineered features including time-based variables (e.g., hour of the day), weather conditions, and traffic data to enrich the dataset.

2. **Creative Visualization**:
   - Developed interactive visualizations to depict spatial and temporal aspects of delivery operations.
   - Inspired by projects like "A Day in the Life" to showcase pilot movements and delivery interactions.

3. **Causal Learning and Predictive Modeling**:
   - Built causal graphs to understand relationships between variables influencing delivery fulfillment.
   - Utilized machine learning models (e.g., XGBoost, Random Forest) to predict and optimize pilot placements.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- Causal Inference (Judea Pearlâ€™s Framework)
- Data Visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn, Datashader)

## Repository Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, modeling, and visualization.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and model training.
- `tests/`: Unit testing the scripts

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional for running notebooks)
- Libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoraaOntita/Logistic-optimization-Delivery-drivers-location-optimisation-with-Causal-Inference-.git
   cd Logistic-optimization-Delivery-drivers-location-optimisation-with-Causal-Inference-
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Running the Code:
- Explore the Jupyter notebooks in notebooks/ for step-by-step analysis and visualization.
- Execute Python scripts in scripts/ for specific data processing tasks.

### Results and Findings:
- Visualizations provide insights into delivery patterns and operational recommendations.

## Next Steps:
- Implement recommendations derived from the analysis to improve pilot placement and reduce unfulfilled delivery requests.
- Optimize logistics operations to streamline delivery routes and reduce delivery times.
- Continuously monitor and iterate upon the models based on real-time data feedback.
